The values here were quite obscure, but as per the name of the challenge, it had something to do with a **pig**! There is actually a language called Pig Latin, which works as follows:

<li> Words that start with a vowel (A, E, I, O, U) simply have "WAY" appended to the end of the word.</li>
<li> Words that start with a consonant have all consonant letters up to the first vowel moved to the end of the word (as opposed to just the first consonant letter), and "AY" is appended.</li>

<br>If you use an online translator from Pig Latin to English, you would get the translation as follows:

<li>retrieve user information</li>
<li>network statistics</li>
<li>system information</li>
<li>create new folder</li>
<li>display information in text file</li>
<li>change directory</li>

<br>In turn, if you search the corresponding commands, you will find the following:

<li>whoami</li>
<li>netstat</li>
<li>systeminfo</li>
<li>mkdir</li>
<li>more</li>
<li>cd</li>

<br>If you concatenate these, you will get the solution!

Therefore the answer is **WHOAMI_NETSTAT_SYSTEMINFO_MKDIR_MORE_CD**.

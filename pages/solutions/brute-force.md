Most of this challenge consisted of little tasks to do along the way, so hopefully you took part in these.

In regards to the final challenge that gave you the token, there are many ways you could have done this. It was purposely an open ended challenge. 

I did it by searching for 'Will Smith's address' as a starting point. I found a website that gave me google image satelite shots, I then found the longitude and latitude of this photo and copied these values into an online tool that translated longitude and latitude coordinates into postal codes. This gave me the answer of **91302-2215**.

Therefore the answer is **91302_2215**.

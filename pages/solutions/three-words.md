For this challenge we provided a set of coordinates. The title and the hint
were supposed to lead you to use a tool called
[what3words](https://what3words.com/). Entering those coordinates into the
search bar on the site gave the response *'price.water.house'*.

Making this uppercase, and swapping the dots for underscores gave the answer
for the challenge: **PRICE_WATER_HOUSE**.

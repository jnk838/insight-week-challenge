This was a trickier one. You had to find out what The Luckiest Person to Ever Live meant. There was a man called **Bill Morgan**. who has been given the title of *The Luckiest Person to Ever Live*. You had to find a **video** on YouTube with this title, the link is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqIQxRVXCCM){:target="_blank"}.

In the next stage of the challenge, you needed to watch the video and listen to every time the presenter said a number. You had to add up all these numbers and look out for the 'Super 66' which was written on the whitebard in the shop. You also had to sum this number to the total. This would give you the answer to the challenge.

The calculation was as follows:
<br>Verbal Numbers = 1999 + 37 + 14 + 12 + 2 + 20000 + 250000 + 250000
<br>Super 66 = 458853

Therefore the answer is **980917**.

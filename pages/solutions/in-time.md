When we as the question we have phrased it in a certain way. 

**What was Googleâ€™s next page Class of 1998?**

We are asking what was the *class* of the item, *'next page'* of the site, '*Google in 1998'*.

So now understanding the question, we have to search 'Google in 1998'. This should automatically redirect us to this site. We then inspect element by right clicking and pressing inspect. At the bottom of the page is the 'next page' button and if we highlight over this we can see the specific code for this button.

In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), the code used to create websites, we have IDs, CLASSES and TAGS associated with each item on the page. In the case of this speciic button, we can see the class used is 'DH6Rkf'.

Therefore the answer is **DH6RKF**.

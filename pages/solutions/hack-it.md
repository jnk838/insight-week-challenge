This was most likely the hardest challenge we set you.

We gave you a [link](https://hackertyper.net "I might help you"){:target="_blank"} and a set of
codes...

`15-4`
`55-1`
`83-1`
`217-10`
`269-1`

`143-10`
`217-10`

`7-2`
`59-1`
`261-1`

If you opened the link and started typing, random code would appear, if you
copied the code into a text editor it would be a lot easier to manipulate and
keep track of, this might have helped you, but was not necessary. The hardest
part was to work out what the code meant, and this was designed to throw you
and make you think laterally at the problem, not to overcomplicate it.

* Each line of numbers represented a word.
* Each set of numbers (separated by a hyphen) represented a letter.
* The first number (before the hyphen) is a line number, representing a word
from the website on that line.
* The second number (after the hyphen) is a word number, representing the
number of words preceding the word required.
* You needed to take the first letter, as given by the hint, of each of the
codes above to get the token.

For example, to get the first letter, *'W'*, of the answer you need to do the
following.

You were given that the first letter was `15-4`. You then needed to go to line
15 of the text and then to the 4th word. Then take the first letter which was
*'W'*. Then follow this process through for the next 5 codes in that paragraph
to get the word *'WRITE'*, then the next 2 codes for that paragraph
representing the words *'IT'* and then the last 3 codes which represent the
word *'NOW'*. Put all these to get the answer, **WRITE_IT_NOW**.

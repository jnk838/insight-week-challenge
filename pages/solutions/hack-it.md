This was most likely the hardest challenge we set you.

We gave you a [link](https://hackertyper.net "I might help you") and a set of
codes...

`15-4`
`55-1`
`83-1`
`217-10`
`269-1`

`143-10`
`217-10`

`7-2`
`59-1`
`261-1`

If you opened the link and started typing, random code would appear, if you copied the code into a text editor it would be a lot easier to manipulate and keep track of, this might have helped you, but was not necessary. The hardest part was to work out what the code meant, and this was designed to throw you and make you think laterally at the problem, not to overcomplicate it. 

* Each line of numbers represented a word. 
* Each set of numbers (seperated by a hiphen) represented a word. 
* The first number (before the hiphen) is a line number, representing a word from the website on that line. 
* The second number (after the hiphen) is a word number, representing the number of words preceeding the word required. 
* You needed to take the first letter, as given by the hint, of each of the codes above to get the token. 

Answer - **WRITE_IT_NOW**

For example, to get the first letter, `W`, of the answer you need to do the following.

You were given that the first letter was `15-4`. You then needed to go to `line 15` of the website and then to the `4th word`. Then take the `first letter` which was `W`. Then follow this process through for the next `5 codes` in that paragraph to get the word `WRITE`, then the next `2 codes` for that paragraph representing the word `IT` and then the last `3 codes` which represents the word `NOW`. Put all these to get the answer, `WRITE_IT_NOW`.

The questions was: *What can I make with just a desert and water?* and a link
to the game *Little Alchemy* was given.

This link was a slight red-herring and you just needed to know what the game
did, which was to combine several raw items together to get new items. For
example, if you combined fire and water you get steam. Using this principle,
the number of items exponentially grows and more and more obscure items begin
to form.

If you found a cheat to this principle and searched for a complete list of
Little Alchemy items, such as this one
[here](https://www.ign.com/wikis/little-alchemy/Little_Alchemy_Cheats_-_List_of_All_Combinations "All possible combinations"),
you'd then be able to search through that list to find which items were able to
be made from just a desert and water. The easiest way to do this was to use the
*find in page* tool in your browser to search for 'desert'. This was relevant
to only a few items and so you could easily work out which ones just required
water to be formed, by going through them manually. There was only one item
that could be formed by these two items and it also happens to be the name of a
band, hence the musical clue.

Therefore the answer is **OASIS**.

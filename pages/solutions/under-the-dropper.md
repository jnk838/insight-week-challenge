We purposely made this sound harder than it is! Sorry! In principle this is a very simple challenge.

If you download the logo in the top left corner, and then zoom in on the *left handle* of the trophy, you will see the text **TINY_TEXT_HERE**. This was not the code and one that I'm sure may of you tried! In fact, you needed to find out the *colour* of this text, in **hexadecimal** to get the correct answer. However, if you zoomed in very closely using a colour dropper online or an app (to find the hex value), then you would have noticed that, becasue the text is so small, the colour values differed very slightly. This is where the hint came in handy.

**X marks the spot!** This suggests that you should take the RGB (red green blue) value of the centre of the X which is **141 223 92** and then translate this to hex using an online tool like [this](https://www.rgbtohex.net){:target="_blank"} one. 

Therefore the answer is **8DDF5C**.

You may have needed to take a screenshot of the zoomed in picture if you were using an online eye dropper tool.

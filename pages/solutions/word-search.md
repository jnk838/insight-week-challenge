This was, potentially, a long challenge, but hopefully not actually too difficult! For this solution, I will list the questions and flow through the answers in turn.

**1. What was the BuNo of Walter G. Jeffery’s last flight?**

Walter G. Jeffery was a pilot involved in the rescue mission for Flight 19 however this plane also went missing somewhere over the Bermuda Triangle! If you literally searched this question in Google, you could see the Wikipedia website with the answer of Bureau Number **'59225'**.

**2. What country has the closest population to this BuNo?**

If you searched 'country populations' and found a website with a table containing all populations, ensuring it is in numerical order you could find the closest number to 59225 which in this case was 59,190 in the **'Marshall Islands'**.

**3. What language do they speak in this country?**

This should have been a quick job on Google, the answer was **'Marshallese'**.

**4. What nine letter word can you make from the name of this language, beginning with the letter ‘a’?**

If you entered the answer, Marshallese, into an anagram solver - it would have told you the answer of **'amarelles'** which was the nine letter word beginning with the letter 'a'.

**5. What is the translation of this word in latin?**

If you looked at, yet again, the Wikipedia page for 'amarelles' it would have told you the latin was **'prunus cerasus'**.

**6. What year was the first known use of the this latin word?**

On the same Wikipedia page, it would have told you the year was estimated for **'1753'**.

**7. Where, in the UK, had an earthquake in this year?**

If you searched 'earthquakes in 1753' it would have given you a log of all the UK earthquakes, and if you scrolled down to 1753 you could see that it occured in **'Skipton'**.

**8. What is the national park called near this town?**

If you have a look on Google Maps, and search 'Skipton', you can see that the closest National Park is **'The Yorkshire Dales'**.

**9. What is the area of this national park in square kilometres?**

If you search 'area of Yorkshire Dales', Google will spit out the result of **'2179'** immediately.

**10. If you treat this number as a year, what film birthed characters in this year?**

If you search 'what happened in 2179', you would be directed to the relevant website and shown that two characters were born for a very famous film called **'Star Trek'**.

Hence, the fianl answer is **STAR_TREK**.

If you go on the [Google NGRAM Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams){:target="_blank"} and type in <strong>'It's like a *'</strong>, the asterix acts as a wildcard where it will autofill the asterix with the most common answers. 

Google NGRAM Viewer lets you find and visualize how words and phrases have developed and been used over time using the 30 million print books Google has scanned working with libraries located around the world as its dataset.

We can see that if we look at the graph in the year 1917, the highest result is <strong>It's like a dream</strong> so in this case that is the answer!

Therefore the answer is **DREAM**.

This challenge was a relatively simple one. It told you to use this
[link](http://stars.chromeexperiments.com "I might help you"){:target="_blank"} and then wanted
you to find out which stars are represented by the following numbers.

`21185`, `1618`, `753`

If you zoom in to the collection of stars, you'll be able to see the names of
the stars followed by some numbers. The stars with the numbers above were:

* Lalande 21185
* Groombridge 1618
* HR 753

These stars may not be immediately visible, so you may need to zoom in closely
and move around a little.

So the answer was **LALANDE_GROOMBRIDGE_HR**.

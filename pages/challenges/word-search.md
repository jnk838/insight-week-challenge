Search engines are an incredibly important part in all of our lives in the modern day. If we have a question, we naturally search it. This exercise should give you the practice needed to find speedy ways to search things online, none of the questions below require difficult, long-winded, searches. Each question can be answered with one query in a search engine and the answer should be given on a website on the first page of the search, given the phrasing in the search is well written.

We have got ten questions below, each one gives an answer that follows on to the following question, so there is many ways to go wrong but highly satisfying when you get it correct. The answer for the final question is the token for the challenge so good luck!

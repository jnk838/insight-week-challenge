Codes are all around us. In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. In some cases, different languages could be a type of encryption as it is a change of form of text. 

I have "*encrypted*" some **command prompt** and **terminal** command titles, please can you tell me what the commands are in the order below:

<li>etrieveray userway informationway
<li>etworknay atisticsstay
<li>ystemsay informationway
<li>eatecray ewnay olderfay
<li>isplayday informationway inway exttay ilefay
<li>angechay irectoryday

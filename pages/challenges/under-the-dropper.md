Images are really interesting assets. There is much more to them than meets the eye. What makes an image an image? Images are formed of pixels. A 'pixel' (short for â€˜picture element') is a tiny square of colour. Each pixel has a specific number and this number tells the computer what colour the pixel should be. 

Colour values are stored in binary for each pixel and can be represented in hexadecimal. Hexadecimal (or hex) is a base 16 system used to simplify how binary is represented. A hex digit can be a numerical digit or a letter A-F. Each hex digit reflects a 4-bit binary sequence.

This image shows the equivalent hex values in binary and denary:

Some of this information might be needed for the question:

**What is the hidden value in the logo?**

It might not be the obvious, think about what else has been changed from the original the image.

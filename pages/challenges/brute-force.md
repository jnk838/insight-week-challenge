Cyber security has become a hot topic in recent years and rightly so. Hackers are hungry for data, they have very sophisticated measures to try and break into your accounts and extract information. 

In this challenge we are going to explore **Brute Force** attacks, these are when the hacker will attempt to breach your account by trying lots of different passwords. These are stored in a word file and tried in order of how likely they are to be your password. There are obviously more sophisticated ways of guessing your password to get into your accounts and disrupt your ways of working but this is the simplest one to explore now. 

So, how might you come up with a password to secure your account? Maybe through experiences or something related to you. These can sometimes be easily guessed and so it is good practice to think of a few random words, numbers and symbols and combine these to create the most secure password as possible. 

**Thinking about experiences, look at the image below and spot the difference between the two mobile phones, name the differences on both phones. Note this down in the format of a token. This is your password.**

**Once, you have this answer, use the table below to calculate how long it would take a hacker using *Brute Force* to gain access your account via this password.**

**Now, use a website to find out how long it would take to hack this password. What else could you include in this password to make it more secure?**

If this password was used multiple times across many different platforms, a hacker could go and try other websites with these same login details. If this happens, you are literally handing the hackers access to everything on a plate! Make sure you use different passwords and credentials over different websites and applications to avoid this.

If you use this on social media I wonder how much information the hackers could get from your profile. **Take a bit of time to have a look through the information on your social media accounts, what can you find out about yourself?** Can you work out where you live? Your phone number? Your age? Are you happy to share this information publically or should you have a private account? Take this time to check that you are happy sharing the data you currently are.

**To put these skills to the test, in order to get the solution for the challenge, find out where Will Smith lives, using social media and the internet, see if you can deduce his postal code. This will be the token for this challenge.**
